        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

The 20-hectare resort was designed by Moshe Safdie architects. The architect was Aedas, and they were responsible for employing all consultants and for developing, co-ordinating and implementing the design. Engineering was provided by Arup and Parsons Brinkerhoff (MEP). The main contractor was Ssangyong Engineering and Construction."</string>
    <string name="desc_sflyer">"Sticking out among the skyscrapers in the Singapore skyline, the Singapore Flyer is no ordinary orb. Instead, this is where to go for the most magnificent views of the city.

A scenic spin on the Singapore Flyer takes you 165 metres above ground, or as high as 42 storeys, as you marvel at the spectacular scenery below.

Located in the heart of downtown Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer is now Asia's largest giant observation wheel.

More importantly, it is high on thrills for tourists and locals alike. Step into one of the 28 fully air-conditioned glass capsules, and be transported on a 30-minute journey of stunning day and night scenes.

From your capsule on top of the world, feast your eyes on iconic and historical landmarks and views from Marina Bay to the Singapore River, such as Raffles Place, Merlion Park, Empress Place and the Padang.

With any luck, you’ll be able to spot landmarks up to 45 kilometres away, like Changi Airport, Sentosa Island and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia."</string>
    <string name="desc_vivo">"VivoCity (Chinese: 怡丰城) is the largest shopping mall in Singapore. Located in the HarbourFront precinct of Bukit Merah, it was designed by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito. Its name is derived from the word vivacity.

According to Mapletree chairman Edmund Cheng, VivoCity \"evokes a lifestyle experience that is modern, stimulating and accessible to everyone, a place bubbling with energy and flowing with vitality\". In December 2016, VivoCity was recognized by Forbes as one of the top shopping malls in Singapore."</string>
    <string name="desc_rws">"Resorts World Sentosa (Abbreviation: RWS) is an integrated resort on the island of Sentosa, off the southern coast of Singapore. The key attractions include one of Singapore's two casinos, a Universal Studios theme park, Adventure Cove Water Park, and S.E.A. Aquarium, which includes the world's largest oceanarium.

The S$6.59 billion (US$4.93 billion) resort was developed by Genting Singapore. It was the third most expensive building ever constructed. The resort occupies over 49 hectares (120 acres) of land and, when fully open, will employ more than 10,000 people directly. Resorts World Sentosa is a sister resort to Resorts World Genting, Pahang, Malaysia and Resorts World Manila, Philippines.

The soft launch of the first four hotels took place on 20 January 2010, with the FestiveWalk shopping mall following on 1 February. The casino opened on 14 February 2010 on the first auspicious day of the Chinese New Year. The Maritime Experiential Museum opened on 15 October 2011 and the last attraction opened on 22 November 2012, The Marine Life Park.

The grand opening of the integrated resort was held on 7 December 2012, officiated by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong together with Genting Group Chairman Lim Kok Thay. Resorts World Sentosa is also expected to hold large-scale exhibitions such as Valentino, Retrospective: Past/Present/Future."</string>
    <string name="desc_btrt">"The temple is based on the Tang dynasty architectural style and built to house the tooth relic of the historical Buddha. The ground breaking ceremony was conducted on 13 March 2005. Costing S$62 million and 2 years later, a soft launch was held to coincide with the 2007 Vesak Day celebration. It is claimed that the relic of Buddha from which it gains its name was found in 1980 in a collapsed stupa in Myanmar. The relic can be viewed by the public at the 4th floor of the temple.

Since opening, the temple has become a popular attraction within Chinatown. Simple vegetarian fare is served in the basement of the temple, though donations are accepted."</string>
    <string name="desc_zoo">"The Singapore Zoo, formerly known as the Singapore Zoological Gardens and commonly known locally as the Mandai Zoo, occupies 28 hectares (69 acres) on the margins of Upper Seletar Reservoir within Singapore's heavily forested central catchment area. The zoo was built at a cost of $9 million granted by the government of Singapore and opened on June 27, 1973. It is operated by Wildlife Reserves Singapore, who also manage the neighbouring Night Safari, River Safari and the Jurong Bird Park. There are about 315 species of animal in the zoo, of which some 16 percent are considered to be threatened species. The zoo attracts 1.7 million visitors each year.

From the beginning, Singapore Zoo followed the modern trend of displaying animals in naturalistic, 'open' exhibits with hidden barriers, moats, and glass between the animals and visitors. It houses the largest captive colony of orangutans in the world."</string>

	<string name="desc_scienceCenter">"With more than a thousand interactive exhibits spanning 14 galleries, Science Centre Singapore is an ideal space to inspire the next generation of Newtons or Einsteins. Trek to the centre of the earth through a crack in the surface to discover the different layers that lay beneath. Or power an engine just using the heat from your palm! These are just some of the fun activities that can be found at 20 permanent exhibitions such as the Ecogarden, which showcases a variety of plants, all growing naturally and receiving no special care.

Defending Science exhibits the latest in surveillance, flight, armour and radar used in the battlefield, while Quirky illustrates how fun science can be with displays of unique innovations. Shows and demonstrations are scheduled daily and are designed to make learning exciting. You can witness a spectacular Fire Tornado Demonstration in safety, get up close with a giant hissing cockroach on your hand, or gaze into the stars at the observatory. Both kids and adults will learn something new here, and even those who aren’t science buffs will be entertained by all the weird and wonderful activities on offer.

The Science Centre also boasts two other key attractions. The Omni-Theatre is Singapore’s only IMAX dome theatre, which features a 5-storey high dome screen that immerses you into the action. Watch saber-toothed and woolly mammoths come to live on the massive screen, or go eye to eye with a dancing bear. For a taste of winter in our tropical city, be sure to step into the Snow City, Singapore’s first permanent indoor snow centre. In this sub-zero environment, you can whiz down the snow slope on a snow tube, and come face to face with sculptures of extinct animals. While here, catch The Snow Show, a performance on the ice, and discover more about the properties of ice, snow and water."</string>
	
	<string name="desc_fortCanning">"Fort Canning Hill, previously known as Bukit Larangan and Government Hill, is 156 ft high and located at the junction of Canning Rise and Fort Canning Road. It has been a landmark since Singapore’s earliest recorded history. In the 14th century, it was likely the site of a palace whose ruins were still visible in 1821. Sir Stamford Raffles had a bungalow built on the hill which became the residence of subsequent colonial governors until Fort Canning was built on it in the 1850s. In the 1920s, the fort was vacated and a large covered service reservoir for the city was constructed. 

Key historic events had taken place on the hill, including the establishment of the Botanic Gardens and Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival’s decision to surrender to the Japanese. The hill was also known as Bukit Tuan Bonham, Bukit Bendera, and Singapore Hill. In 1972, the greenery around Fort Canning was known as Central Park with the amalgamation of King George V Park (set up prior to World War II) and the land occupied by the British Armed Forces. The River Valley Road end of the park used to house the National Theatre and the Van Kleef Aquarium. It also had a roller-skating rink, a playground, a Vietnamese restaurant and a squash centre.

The park was renamed Fort Canning Park with the planting of a fruit tree by then prime minister Lee Kuan Yew on 1 November 1981. Today, Fort Canning Park is a venue for celebrations. Its expansive, sprawling lawns play host to concerts, theatre productions and festivals such as Shakespeare in the Park, Ballet Under the Stars, Shakespeare in the Park and Films at the Fort, while weddings, parties and gatherings are a regular sight in the park's venue spaces. Its ancient artefacts are a must-see for history buffs, and its lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. Whether you are drawn by the park’s ancient artefacts and rich heritage or simply its tranquillity, this hilltop park offers something for the whole family."</string>

	<string name="desc_marinaBarrage">"The Marina Barrage is a dam in Singapore built at the confluence of five rivers, across the Marina Channel between Marina East and Marina South. It was officially opened on 1 November 2008. It was Singapore's fifteenth reservoir. As the water in the reservoir remains calm all year around, it’s ideal for some soaking wet fun, whether it’s kayaking or, for the more team-spirited, a dragon boat race. If water sports is not your thing, head to the rooftop of the barrage, which boasts a green space that’s popular for flying a kite, or just to chill out with the family. 
	
The Marina Barrage also plays an important part in helping to alleviate flooding in some of the lower lying areas of the island. During periods of heavy rain, a series of nine crest gates will be opened to release excess storm water into the sea when the tide is low. When the tide is high, seven giant pumps that are capable of pumping an Olympic-sized swimming pool per minute whirr into action, draining water into the sea.The facility is also a showcase for Singapore’s push to be a greener country. The Solar Park, for instance, features one of the largest collections of solar panels in Singapore, with over 400 panels providing electricity needed for lighting at the barrage during the day. "</string>

	<string name="desc_Istana">"The Istana is the official residence and office of the President of Singapore. Meaning "palace" in Malay, it is where the President receives and entertains state guests. The Istana is also the working office of the Prime Minister of Singapore. The 106-acre (0.4-km²) estate was once part of the extensive nutmeg plantation of Mount Sophia. In 1867, the British colonial government acquired the land and built a mansion to be the official home of the British governor. This continued until 1959 when Singapore was granted self-government, and the governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who was in turn replaced by the President. 
	
In spite of its location at the heart of the city, the Istana domain is a green lung amid the arteries of metropolitan bustle. Standing on what used to be Charles Robert Prinsep’s nutmeg plantation, the estate is a treasure trove of flora and fauna. Since 1960, the Istana grounds have been open to the public a few days every year so that Singaporeans and visitors could also enjoy the sprawling parkland. Overall management of the extensive grounds is the responsibility of the Senior Curator from National Parks. He and his team of curators and gardeners not only maintain the grounds, but also step in whenever simple landscaping works are needed for functions held at the Istana.
	
The Istana is similar in architecture to many 18th Century neo-Palladian style buildings designed by British military engineers in India. It had a tropical layout like a Malay House, surrounded by verandahs, louvred windows and panelled doors, to promote cross ventilation, and an airy and cool interior. The central 3-storey high tower block dominates the building. This 'one-stage' tower is crowned with a slated mansard roof. It has dormer windows and is embellished with Corinthian pilaster and beautiful cornices. The 2-storey side wings are ornamented with Ionic colonnades at the second storey and Doric colonnades at the first storey. A pediment and portico terminate the colonnades at both ends."</string>

	<string name="desc_hawPar">"Built in 1937, Haw Par Villa is famous for its often gruesome depictions of Chinese folklore’s 10 Courts of Hell. But this wonderful theme park also has more, shall we say, tasteful scenes from other Chinese legends, such as Journey to the West and Madame White Snake. Pick your favourite from the over 1,000 colourful statues and tableaux on display, among them a giant gorilla and massive deity heads.

Located on a hill in Pasir Panjang, Haw Par Villa is named after the Burma-born Aw brothers, who created the medical ointment Tiger Balm. Created for his younger brother Boon Par, the older Boon Haw saw the $2-million circular-shaped house and its sprawling garden as a journey into Chinese mythology. In its early years, the grounds were opened to the public, and even had a zoo. But when World War II broke out, the brothers abandoned the house and fled overseas. Japanese forces took over, using it to watch over ships at sea.

After the war, Boon Par’s son Aw Cheng Chye added the finishing touches to the park. Many visited in the 1970s and 1980s on day trips and school excursions - adult Singaporeans will cheekily tell you of the nightmares the park gave them as kids! In 1985, the Singapore Tourism Board acquired the land and gave the park a face lift. Now, you can hop on a guided tour that takes you on a trail of the world’s only eclectic Chinese mythological park of its kind. Visitor discretion and parental guidance are advised for visitors to the “10 Courts of Hell” due to the graphic nature of the exhibits. Admission to the park is free."</string>
	
	<string name="desc_esplanade">"Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, also known as the Esplanade Theatre or simply The Esplanade, is a 60,000 square metres performing arts centre located in Marina Bay near the mouth of the Singapore River. Pop by Esplanade at any time and you’ll find it hard not to be infected by its palpable creative vibe, whether it’s the ever-changing larger than life visual arts display near the main entrance or the world-class performances staged here. The shows featured cut across cultures and genres. You can catch a concert by Western greats such as The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra or a Chinese play inspired by the late doyen of Singapore Chinese theatre Kuo Pao Kun.

Fondly nicknamed "the Durian” by Singaporeans for its resemblance to the popular fruit here, Esplanade holds a 1,600-seat Concert Hall, a 2,000-seat Theatre and several more intimate performance venues, and has hosted high-profile events such as the return of the quintessential musical Les Misérables. Free programmes, from music and dance to theatre, also regularly take place at various locations in Esplanade. Before you attend a performance, catch a pre-show dinner or a coffee at one of the restaurants or cafes at the three-storey Esplanade Mall, including the newest addition—the Esplanade Annexe. You can also squeeze in a quick spot of shopping at the retail outlets, picking up goods as diverse as customised hand lotions, or maybe a violin or two."</string>

	<string name="desc_krajiWarMem">"The Kranji War Memorial in Kranji in northern Singapore. Dedicated to the men and women from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died defending Singapore and Malaya against the invading Japanese forces during World War II, it comprises the War Graves, the Memorial Walls, the State Cemetery, and the Military Graves. Here, you’ll see more than 4,400 white gravestones lined up in rows on the cemetery’s gentle slope. The Chinese Memorial in plot 44 marks a mass grave for 69 Chinese servicemen who were killed by the Japanese when Singapore fell in February 1942. As you walk the short flight of steps to the hilltop terrace, you’ll see four memorials.

The largest is the Singapore Memorial, with its huge star-topped central pylon that rises to a height of 24 metres. This memorial bears the names of more than 24,346 Allied soldiers and airmen killed in Southeast Asia who have no known grave. You can find the register, kept by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, at the entrance. Every year, on the Sunday closest to Remembrance Day on 11 November, a memorial service is held to pay tribute to those who gave their lives. Next to the Kranji War Memorial is the Kranji Military Cemetery, a non-world war site of more than 1,400 burials, as well as the Singapore State Cemetery, where the country’s first and second presidents, Encik Yusof Ishak and Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares, are buried."</string>

	<string name="desc_jurongFrog">"Mr Wan Bock Thiaw started supplying frogs to the market in the 1970s, starting Jurong Frog Farm (JFF) in 1981 because he foresaw the potential of farming the American Bullfrog. Today JFF is a thriving business. In an age where people are becoming increasingly conscious of healthy eating and the importance of food safety, providers of healthy, nutritious products like JFF are growing in relevance by supplying alternative products like frog meat, crocodile tail, venison flank steak and locally produced Hashima products. His youngest daughter, Chelsea started working full time at the farm in 2006.

She recognized that education of this farming industry to the public was imperative as young Singaporeans need to be brought back in touch with the land and she believed that everyone ought to know of the existence and importance of farms. She has strived to change the stereotype of farms being old school and backward by introducing the farm’s mascot, Gabbe King, which can be seen on the walls of the farm premise in his trademark yellow gumboots, and by introducing many fun froggie merchandise now retailing at The Royal Frog Shop. With the increasing number of locals and foreigners hopping into the frog farm year after year, Frogology Pte Ltd was established on the 18th July 2014, to give all visitors a learning journey they will not forget, with the aim of sharing the insights of frog farming and the world of American Bullfrogs."</string>

	<string name="desc_jurongBird">"Jurong Bird Park is an aviary and tourist attraction in Jurong, Singapore. The bird park, managed by Wildlife Reserves Singapore, covers an area of 0.2 square kilometres on the western slope of Jurong Hill, the highest point in the Jurong region. For an up-close encounter with some of our prettiest and rarest feathered friends, step into Jurong Bird Park. Spread across 20.2 hectares in a western corner of Singapore, this sprawling park is Asia’s largest, with a collection of over 5,000 birds from 400 species. You’ll meet the many feathered residents during daily feeding sessions, even glimpsing elusive birds like the crested guinea fowl, iridescent starling and turaco. Don’t miss the Waterfall Aviary, one of the world’s largest walk-in aviaries, home to more than 600 birds and a 30-metre-high waterfall.

There are other star attractions at this sprawling park, including the world’s largest walk-in lory flight aviary at over nine stories high, where you’ll get close to 15 colourful lory species, and the impressive Penguin Coast where you’ll find many species of these flightless birds. There is also Flamingo Lake with hundreds of these strutting birds, and nearby Pelican Cove, with the world’s most complete collection of pelicans. Be entertained by these majestic creatures of flight too. Witness the heat of the hunt as mighty eagles, falcons and hawks show off their moves during the Kings of the Skies Show, or be part of the flock at the High Flyers Show. If that is not enough, you can also dine with the parrots and penguins. Kids will especially love Birdz of Play, the bird-themed water playground, for a soaking good time under the giant tipping bucket, zipping across the Flying Fox and even arcade games.

A visit to this amazing bird sanctuary is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet. "</string>

	<string name="desc_catCafe">"The Cat Cafe provides the perfect combination of cats, coffee,tea and pastries. Its the purr-fect place to go to interact with your feline friends in a safe and clean environment. Cats in The Cat Cafe are either ex-stray or adopted, hence dont be suprised if they kind of look familiar to you.

The Cat Cafe also serves freshly brewed coffee, top notch tea and freshly baked pastries. Come down and have both your taste buds and furry instincts satisfied!"</string>

	<string name="desc_nekoCafe">"While cat cafes in Japan, Korea and Bangkok usually feature only pedigreed cats, Sam and Sue made a decision to only adopt cats for their cafe. This is their message – Adopt, don’t buy! All cats deserved to be loved, what more the homeless and abandoned ones? They want to show that non-pedigreed cats can be beautiful and affectionate companions. With more than 15 years of cat care experience behind them, Sam and Sue want to share the joy and knowledge of cat ownership which seem to be lacking in Singapore. Myths like ‘cats are dirty, noisy and aloof’ can’t be further from the truth. The only way to dispel such myths is to create an opportunity for people to spend time with cats and experience for themselves what lovely, responsive and intelligent companions cats can be.

With Cat Cafe Neko no Niwa (Japanese for ‘Cat Garden’), Sam and Sue take their first step towards changing mindsets. Of the many rescued cats Sam and Sue have met, these cafe cats proved to be real superstars! Only cats with personalities suited for a cat cafe lifestyle were picked. This lifestyle means lots of human attention, lots of playing, and lots of other cats."</string>
